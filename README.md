# MEDIAL

Located in the School of Technology, Beijing Forestry University, the Multi - modal Ecological Data Intelligent Analysis Laboratory (MEDIAL) is dedicated to advancing research in the field of ecological data analysis through multi - modal approaches. Our work encompasses various aspects such as data preprocessing, the development and application of advanced algorithms like TDNN (Time - Delay Neural Network) and RFTI (Relevant Field and Target Identification), open - set recognition techniques, and strategies for enhancing ecological sound data by removing non - avian sounds. We strive to leverage intelligent methods to gain deeper insights into ecological systems and contribute to ecological research and conservation efforts.
